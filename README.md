# EEG and COVID-19 Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting hospital mortality outcomes in COVID-19 patients using EEG features and clinical variables with various supervised machine learning algorithms.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset includes EEG test indicators, neurological complications, and clinical metadata (e.g., coma, ventilator use, sedatives, metabolic abnormalities) collected from 192 patients.

## 📌 Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Missing data, outliers, encoding)
- Feature Engineering
- Supervised Models: Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
- Hyperparameter Optimization with GridSearchCV
- Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

## 📁 Structure
- `bitcoin_covid_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook version of the analysis
- `bitcoin_covid_prediction.py`: Python script version
- `report/`: Original PDF report
- `images/`: Placeholder for graphs and figures
- `README.md`: This file

## ⚙️ Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Output
ROC curves, classification reports, and confusion matrices for model comparison.
